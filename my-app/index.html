                        <p>We are experiencing what Gallup calls 'an employee engagement crisis'. Just one-third of people at work are engaged.</p>
                        <p>To improve performance and engagement companies rely on the same principles as industrial-age factories. But all those annual performance reviews and hundred-question surveys don't work anymore. People want regular feedback. Leaders who don't embrace this change end up with misaligned, disengaged and dwindling team.</p>
                        <p>We designed Teambit to change that. It empowers teams to make feedback a daily habit. Everybody knows what they are doing well and what they need to improve, leading to better performing, engaged and happier teams.</p>
                        <p>We are on a mission to make worklife exciting. Come join us.</p>
